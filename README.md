[Release Notes](https://github.com/pallet/alembic/blob/develop/ReleaseNotes.md)

Alembic is a clojure library that allows you to distill jars onto your classpath
in a running JVM instance.  It uses leiningen and pomegranate to resolve the
jars, classlojure to isolate leiningen and its dependencies, and dynapath to
modify the classpath.

This means you can use lein and pomegranate without their dependencies
interfering with your project classpath.  The only dependencies added are
classlojure and dynapath - both smallish libraries (though I wish classlojure
didn't depend on useful, which is rather a large dependency for the one function
it uses from the library).

## Project Dependency

To use Alembic with nREPL or any other clojure REPL, you will need to add
Alembic to you development dependencies.  For a leiningen based project, you can
do this by adding it to the `:dependencies` vector of the `:dev` profile in
`project.clj`.

```clj
:profiles {:dev {:dependencies [[alembic "0.1.3"]]}}
```

You can enable Alembic on all you projects, by adding it to the `:dependencies`
vector of the `:user` profile in `~/.lein/profiles.clj`.

## Usage

To add a dependency to the classpath, use the `distill` function, passing a
leiningen style dependency vector.

```clj
(alembic.still/distill '[org.clojure/tools.logging "0.2.0"])
```

If the dependency is added to the classpath, `distill` returns a sequence of
maps, where each map represents a dependent jar.  Those jars without a current
version on the classpath will be added to the classpath.  The jars with a
version already on the classpath are not added to the classpath, and the
currently loaded version is reported on the :current-version key.

The distill function returns nil, with no side-effects, if the dependency is
already on the classpath.

By default, `distill` uses the repositories in the current lein project.  You
can override this by passing a map of lein style repository information to the
`:repositories` option.  The `project-repositories` function can be used to
obtain the lein project repositories, should you want to adapt these to pass as
an `:repositories` argument.

You can query the dependencies that have been added with the
`dependencies-added` function, which returns a sequence of leiningen style
dependency vectors.

You can lookup the dependency jars for the distilled dependencies, using the
`dependency-jars` function.

The `conflicting-versions` function returns a sequence of dependencies for a
distilled dependency, where the dependency jar version doesn't match the version
currently on the classpath.
